The following document constitutes the DuoCircle’s Account Ownership, Access Recovery and Service Separation Policy (the “Policy”). If you (a “Customer”) no longer have access to your account, or your account has been terminated, please follow the instructions below to regain access to your services, or create a new account.

Please note: For privacy and security reasons, DuoCircle does not discuss account ownership or recovery matters over the phone or social media. Please contact our Billing Team at billing@duocircle.com for assistance with account access recovery.

## Definition of Ownership
These are the definitions that Customers should be aware of when attempting to regain access to an account or activating services for an account.

## Account Ownership
The creator of every DuoCircle account on a DuoCircle owned and operated website (the “DuoCircle’s Websites”) must, in accordance with the DuoCircle’s Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”) and DuoCircle Services Agreement, provide a contact email address at which DuoCircle may contact him/her (the “Authoritative Contact Email Address”). Before any account is activated, DuoCircle will send an email to the Authoritative Contact Email Address with a link that the prospective account owner must click through to confirm that the account associated with the Authoritative Contact Email Address should be activated.

The person or entity that controls the Authoritative Contact Email Address is considered the “Account Owner.”

## Account Access Recovery
The following methods describe the proper procedures for regaining access to DuoCircle accounts and services:

## Password Reset
All DuoCircle Account Owners may use the Reset Password Form to regain access to their account. An Account Owner may enter either their username or Authoritative Contact Email Address into the form. A confirmation email will be delivered to the Authoritative Contact Email Address, allowing the Account Owner to change their password and log in with new credentials. This is the primary means of account recovery in all circumstances.

## Recovering Free Accounts
“Expired” Accounts
Free accounts are subject to inactivity expiration. If an Account Owner does not log into the account within a rolling thirty (30) day period, the account and its services are subject to deletion from the DuoCircle database. Free accounts cannot and will not be restored by the DuoCircle Billing Team. In the event of a “lost/expired” account, Customers may create a new account by following the steps outlined on the services page.

## Account Deletion for Invalid Email Addresses
The DuoCircle AUP requires Customers to maintain a valid Authoritative Contact Email Address at all times. If the Authoritative Contact Email Address is no longer valid (returns 500-level error code from the responsible mail server, e.g. 550 User Unknown, Message Undeliverable, Delivery Failure, etc.), DuoCircle may, in its sole discretion, terminate the account and any associated services for noncompliance. Upon deletion, accounts and any associated Dynamic DNS hostnames are returned to the pool of available account and service names, allowing Customers to potentially recreate them. DuoCircle shall have no liability in the event a Customer is unable to recreate an account, access an account, or access a Dynamic DNS hostname that was used prior to such termination, expiration or deletion.

To remove a free account with an invalid email address, Customers should contact the DuoCircle Billing Team at billing@www.duocircle.com. In the email, Customers must provide the username associated with the account, briefly explain the situation which informed them that the address on file is invalid and that the Customer wishes to have the account removed. The DuoCircle Billing Team will verify address validity, then, if applicably invalid, remove account at issue and associated services.

Please note: Under no circumstances will DuoCircle transfer, delete or recreate individual services for free accounts. If Customers lose access to a free account, but the Authoritative Contact Email Address is still valid, or otherwise does not return a “permanent” failure (e.g. returns 421 Service Temporarily Unavailable, mail server times out, etc.), DuoCircle will not remove the account in question. Customers will need to create a new account and choose a different corresponding hostname.

## Recovering Paid Accounts

Information Verification

If the Password Reset method outlined above does not work, a Customer’s next option is to provide certain billing details to verify account ownership. Please contact the DuoCircle Billing Team at billing@duocircle.com with the account name in question and request billing verification. Customer will be asked for certain pieces of information regarding the payment method used to purchase the services on that account; if the information is correct, the DuoCircle Billing Team will update the Authoritative Contact Email Address for the account to a new address of Customer’s choosing. Customer will receive a Change Email confirmation request at the new address. Customer may then issue a Password Reset (see above) to regain access to the account.

Please note: This recovery method is only available to Customers who have used a single credit card to purchase services on their account. If Customer has used more than one credit card, or one credit card in conjunction with another method of payment, even if the billing information is identical, this recovery method will not be available.

## Account Change Form
If the other recovery methods are unavailable to you, control over the account may be recovered by submitting an Administrative/Authoritative Contact Email Address Change Request Form (“Change Request Form”) along with any associated and required documentation. The Change Request Form may be found here. Please note that this recovery method requires an administrative processing fee that must be submitted prior to account recovery.
