What is a chargeback?
When a bank forcibly reverses a credit card transaction, returning funds to the cardholder, it is known as a chargeback. Chargebacks are usually performed when fraudulent purchases have been made on a person’s credit card. However, consumers may request a chargeback for nearly any reason; as a result, it is possible to accidentally commit “friendly fraud.”

How does DuoCircle handle chargebacks?
When DuoCircle receives a chargeback notice, the account in which the service was purchased is immediately blocked, and all associated services in the account are terminated. DuoCircle always considers chargebacks to be the result of fraud; since fraudulent purchases go hand-in-hand with malware and phishing, immediate termination of all services related to the chargeback is the best way to protect the public from harm.

How do I cancel a chargeback?
To undo a chargeback, you must contact your credit card provider and issue a chargeback reversal. Reversing the chargeback is the only way to restore a blocked account. Chargeback reversal notices are often sent by postal mail, which can result in days without access to the account or its services; when contacting your provider, please ensure they fax a copy of the paperwork us to allow us to restore account access as quickly as possible. Our Billing Team at billing@www.duocircle.com will be happy to help you resolve the issue. Remember, the one and only way to restore a blocked account is to reverse the chargeback. This returns the initial funds to us, cancels the penalty fee we receive for “allowing” fraud to be committed, and generally erases any “black marks” against us for the transaction. We do not accept additional payment for services on a different card.
