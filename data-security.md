DuoCircle LLC. (“DuoCircle”) takes all appropriate technical and organizational measures and precautions to keep Customer Data secure and protected from unauthorized access, use or alteration and unlawful destruction.

“Customer Data” includes any personal information collected by DuoCircle as well as data stored in or transmitted through our systems (including, but not limited to, records in our various services and email passing through our various DuoCircle email services).

The steps DuoCircle takes include (but are not limited to):

    Using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data, such as credit card details.
    Limiting access to your Customer Data. Only those employees who need to come into contact with that data, to provide products and services to you, will do so.
    Limiting physical and electronic access to key system. All Customer Data is stored on systems located at monitored and secured sites with physical access restricted to key individuals. No interactive (shell account or otherwise) access is provided to these systems other than to key personnel.
    Allowing for your account data to be password protected. As general best practice on the Internet, it is recommended that individuals do not use trivial passwords. Passwords should contain a combination of letters and numbers, be stored securely, and changed periodically.

If you believe the security of your Customer Data has been compromised in any way, please contact our support department immediately with the details of the incident, and we will investigate appropriately.
