DuoCircle LLC. (“DuoCircle,” “Us,” or “We”) is committed to protecting the privacy of the users of the www.duocircle.com and other DuoCircle website that reference this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Sites”) and the services offered through the Sites (the “Services”).

This Privacy Policy describes DuoCircle’s practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information collected from you through your use of our Sites and Services. It does not apply to DuoCircle sites, services and products that do not display or link to this statement or that have their own privacy statements.

At this point, you are probably asking, “what is Personal Information?”. “Personal Information” is information provided by you to DuoCircle which personally identifies an individual, such as your name, home address, personal email address or telephone number, or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information by DuoCircle.

I. COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION GENERALLY
We collect Personal Information from the users of our Site and Services. We will not sell, share, transfer, or use the Personal Information we collect from you other than as stated in this Privacy Policy.

II. INFORMATION YOU GIVE TO US
When you visit or use our websites or interact with DuoCircle, there are times when DuoCircle will ask you to provide us with your Personal Information. For example, when registering for a new account on our website, we will prompt you to provide us with your name, physical address, email address and phone number. There are also instances in which you may elect to provide us with Personal Information when you use our Sites or interact with DuoCircle. For example, you may provide DuoCircle with your Personal Information when you send email using DuoCircle’s email delivery services or when you contact DuoCircle’s technical support team.

III. INFORMATION WE AUTOMATICALLY COLLECT FROM YOU
While visiting our Sites or using our Services, we may automatically collect Personal Information from you through the use of cookies and other mechanisms. For example, when you visit DuoCircle’s website, we automatically collect device identifiers (e.g., device model, operating system, browser version, and other data that may be used to identify a device), IP addresses, device configurations, browser history, and geographic location data.

IV. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
DuoCircle uses your information for a variety of purposes related to its provisioning, maintenance and improvement of the Services, and the development of new services. For example, DuoCircle uses your Personal Information to administer your account, provide technical support and to communicate with you about your account, the Services and other exciting news about DuoCircle.

Except as provided above, DuoCircle will not use your Personal Information, nor will it share your Personal Information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of DuoCircle, unless one of the following circumstances apply:

With your consent:
We may use and share Personal Information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of DuoCircle when we have your express consent to do so. For example, you may enter into an agreement with DuoCircle that permits DuoCircle to use or disclose Personal Information under circumstances other than those described in this Privacy Policy.

For internal use, research and product development:
We may use your Personal Information for our internal use, research and product development.

For external processing:
We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us based on our instructions or other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

To detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or other legal related issues:
We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of DuoCircle if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
– meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
– enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
– detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
– protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of DuoCircle, our users, third parties or the public as required or permitted by law.

For example, we share device-identifying information, which may consist of Personal Information, to iovation, Inc., a trusted partner that specializes in fraud prevention services, for the purposes of combating fraudulent purchases on our Sites and other fraudulent activities on the Internet.

If DuoCircle is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any Personal Information and give affected users notice before Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

DuoCircle has established a global network presence and may process Personal Information on our servers in many countries around the world. You agree that we may process Personal Information on a server located outside the country where you reside.

DuoCircle will not sell or license your Personal Information to a third party for that third party’s own direct marketing purposes.

This third party provider may use cookies or web beacons to collect such information.

Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. You may also be able to refuse certain web beacons by adjusting the settings on your browser or email software. Please refer to your browser or email software instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.

VII. SECURITY
DuoCircle has implemented policies that include administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to help protect Personal Information against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. While DuoCircle strives to protect your privacy, due to many reasons, including the inherent security flaws in the Internet, DuoCircle cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose to us and, as such, you agree that your disclosure of such information is at your own risk.

VIII. INFORMATION PROCESSED BY DUOCIRCLE’S CLIENTS
Our clients may provide us with Personal Information belonging to their customers or other third parties in connection with their use of our services.
